# NO NUMBER LIMITS!

This is just an experiment where I try to create number types which are not bound to a specific size. The idea is to have a number type which can be used to represent any number, no matter how big or small it is. The only limitation is the available memory.

# Why?

I really don't know. I just wanted to try it out.

# How?

The idea is to use bit vectors which can fit any number. That's it. The only thing that is needed is a way to convert a number to a bit vector and vice versa.

# Already implemented

-   [x] Unsigned integers (`InfUInt`)
-   [ ] Signed integers (`InfInt`)
-   [ ] Floating point numbers (`InfFloat`)

# Speed

It's really slow, but I don't care rn.
